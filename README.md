# Siedler (Settlers)
Siedler is a very simple 2D game I mostly use for prototyping and testing concepts.
It is written completly in Java and uses a modified Hexagon Engine.

## Introduction to the Game
First of all, you really can't call this game a strategy game, since it has a very
linear flow due to the cost of buildings.
At start, you are provided with 2 Stone and 2 Wood with which you can build a settlement,
a quarry or a sawmill. A settlement gives you money which is used in the later game and
the quarry and sawmill give you stone and wood respectively. You get these resources every ~10
seconds.

## Purpose
This Game is a prototype / collection of ideas for a strategy game i'm working on. Due to this
it is very disorganized, linear, ugly and you can't really call it a game.
